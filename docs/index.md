# OSG Management

This is the Open Science Grid (OSG) Management website, providing information about the management structure and activities of the OSG
Consortium.


## Management Overview

The OSG is managed by three key groups, with substantial overlaps in personnel between the groups:

* The **OSG Council** is a group of key stakeholders and the governing body of the OSG Consortium&nbsp;&mdash; for more
  information, [visit the OSG Council website](https://osg-htc.org/council/)

* The **OSG Executive Team** manages the program of work and priorities of the OSG Project&nbsp;&mdash;
  [see below](#executive-team)

* The **OSG Area Coordinators** are leads of OSG functional areas and perform detailed planning and
  tracking&nbsp;&mdash; for more information, [visit the OSG Area Coordinators page](area-coordinators.md)


## Executive Team

The OSG Executive Team manages the program of work and priorities of the OSG
Project, as well as contributions from OSG Consortium members.

Current Executive Team members:

* Frank Würthwein, University of California San Diego, OSG Executive Director
* Miron Livny, University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison, OSG Technical Director and PI
* Brian Bockelman, Morgridge Institute for Research, OSG Services and Technology lead
* Christina Koch, University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison, OSG Research Facilitation lead
* Derek Weitzel, University of Nebraska–Lincoln, Campus, NRP, and HEP representative
* Eric Lançon, Brookhaven National Laboratory, BNL/ATLAS representative
* Eric Sedore, Syracuse University, Resource contributor
* Jérôme Lauret, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Nuclear Physics representative
* Josh Drake & Mike Stanfield, Indiana University, OSG Security leads
* Lisa Goodenough, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Fermilab representative
* Liz Sexton-Kennedy, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Fermilab representative, OSG Council chair
* Mark Neubauer, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, HEP representative
* Rob Gardner, University of Chicago, OSG Collaboration Support
* Tim Cartwright, University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison, OSG Deputy Executive Director


## Management Activities

Major activities of OSG management teams include:

* An annual planning retreat.  At this two-day meeting near the start of each fiscal year, strategies, goals, and plans
  for the coming year and beyond are reviewed, discussed, debated, and settled on.

* A work-breakdown structure (WBS).  Stemming from the annual planning retreat and maintained throughout the year is a
  standard WBS of high-level goals and objectives, including deliverables and milestones.  The Area Coordinators report
  progress on and update the WBS documents periodically, and the OSG Executive team is responsible for the management
  and supervision of the WBS throughout the year.

* OSG Council meetings.  These are scheduled quarterly (two per year in person, two by conference call) and generally
  include reviews of all OSG areas and goals, as well as any other reports the Council requests.  Council members
  provide long-term strategy and supervision of the OSG Project and its management team, including election of the
  Executive Director.

* OSG Executive Team meetings.  The team meets weekly to check in on key projects and discuss particular challenges.

* OSG Area Coordinator meetings.  Also weekly, one or two Area Coordinators present on recent accomplishments, update
  the group on the status of WBS goals, and discuss current or foreseeable challenges.  Because every OSG functional
  area is represented, this is a great venue to discuss cross-area issues.
